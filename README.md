# test-repository

invite me (christopher-potvin-wwc) as a collaborator, and create a readme in that repository explaining pull, fetch, push, merge, commit, fork, clone and branches in one or two sentences each

**Clone** - Copy of remote repository on your computer.
**Fork** - Copy of someone else's repository. Changes you make does not affect their original files.
**Branches** - Copy of your own repository, changes made to branch are not implemented to main repository until merged.

**Commit** - Set of changes to files. Git assigns an ID to each commit to track, who, what, and when the change happened. Must include a commit message (explanation)
**Pull request** - Compares changes made in branch, and allows collaborators to review, accept and suggest.
**Merge** - Adds changes made in a branch to main branch.

**Fetch** - Add changes from remote repository (main project) to local files. Can review before commiting them. Similar to pull.
**Pull** - Fetching changes and merging them to local copy.
**Push** - Adding your local changes to remote repository (opposite of pull).
